      <h2>At a glance...</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>The composition of Madagascar's wildlife reflects the fact that the island has been isolated for about 88 million years. </li>
          <li>The prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana separated the Madagascar-Antarctica-India landmass from the Africa-South America landmass around 135 million years ago.</li>
          <li>Madagascar later split from India about 88 million years ago, allowing plants and animals on the island to evolve in relative isolation.</li>
          <li>As a result of the island's long isolation from neighboring continents, Madagascar is home to an abundance of plants and animals found nowhere else on Earth.</li>
          <li>Approximately 90 percent of all plant and animal species found in Madagascar are endemic, including the lemurs (a type of strepsirrhine primate), the carnivorous fossa and many birds. </li>
          <li>This distinctive ecology has led some ecologists to refer to Madagascar as the "eighth continent", and the island has been classified by Conservation International as a biodiversity hotspot.</li>
